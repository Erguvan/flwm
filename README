flwm Version 0.25

----------------------------------------------------------------
How to compile flwm:
----------------------------------------------------------------

You need fltk.  If you do not have it yet, download it from
http://www.fltk.org, and compile and install it.

To customize flwm (for instance to turn on click-to-type), edit the
config.h file.

Type "./configure" (not necessary if you have gmake)

Type "make"

Become superuser and type "make install"

If you wish to edit the code, type "make depend"

----------------------------------------------------------------
How to run flwm:
----------------------------------------------------------------

To run flwm as your login script, you need to create or replace
~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession (or both).  Newer Linux systems with a login
panel use .xsession, older systems where X was started after login
use .xinitrc.  You may also have to pick "default" from the "type of
session" popup in your login window.

The .xinitrc or .xsession file should look like this:

#!/bin/sh
xsetroot -solid \#006060
xrdb .Xresources
# xset, xmodmap, other configuration programs
flwm &
WindowManager=$!
# xterm, other automatically-launched programs
wait $WindowManager

ALLOWING THE WINDOW MANAGER TO EXIT W/O LOGOUT:

That is the most user-friendly but it logs you out when flwm exits,
which means it logs out if flwm crashes (:-)) and you cannot switch
window managers.  Another possibility is to run another program last
so flwm can exit, by putting lines like this at the end:

/usr/local/bin/flwm -x &
exec rxvt -geometry 80x11+8-8 -C -T "Ctrl-D_to_logout"

The -x tells flwm to put "exit" on the menu rather than "logout".

REDHAT USERS:

You may want to run the program "./flwm_wmconfig".  This will read
RedHat's window manager menu configuration files and build an initial
.wmx directory so you have a large set of menu items that run
programs.

SGI IRIX:

You need to edit the file ~/.xsession instead of ~/.xinitrc.

SGI's version of XDM has a nice feature so that the window manager can
still have a logout command, but you are not logged out if it
crashes.  This is done by running the programs "reaper" and
"endsession", as in this sample .xsession file:

#! /bin/sh
xsetroot -solid \#004040
xrdb .Xresources
reaper
flwm -x &
xwsh -console -t console -iconic &

Also create the file "~/.wmx/Logout" with these contents:

#! /bin/sh
endsession

The result will be that flwm has a menu itme "Logout" that logs you
out.

Usage:
